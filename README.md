# react-vite-tailwind-boilerplate
Pretty self explanatory but this is a simple boilerplate that is great for starting a brand new React application with.

What it includes:
- Vite
- React
- TailwindCSS
- TypeScript

I also included `tailwindcss-children` and a few `not-*` utilities in the `tailwind.config.js` file
